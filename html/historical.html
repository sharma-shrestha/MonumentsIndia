        Historical monuments of India are not just architectural marvels; they
        are living chronicles that narrate the tales of India’s rich and diverse
        past. These physical structures and sites hold significant historical,
        cultural, architectural, and artistic value, representing the legacy of
        various civilizations, dynasties, and empires that have shaped the
        subcontinent over thousands of years. Preserved and protected by
        governments and organizations, these monuments serve as powerful
        reminders of the cultural and historical tapestry of India, offering
        visitors a window into bygone eras. From the iconic Taj Mahal to the
        ancient cave temples of Ajanta, each monument stands as a testament to
        the creativity, craftsmanship, and cultural exchanges that have defined
        India’s heritage.

          The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of
          the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in
          1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to
          house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the
          centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex, which includes a mosque
          and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides
          by a crenellated wall. Construction of the mausoleum was essentially
          completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project
          for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been
          completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to
          be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8
          billion rupees (U.S. $827 million). The construction project employed
          some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led
          by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.

          From Akbar to Jahangir, India was ruled by the Mughal dynasty for
          about four hundred years. The Mughal emperors brought in a lot of
          changes to the country. The Mughal Emperors built many historical
          structures in Delhi and Agra. Red Fort or Lal Qila is one of them,
          which signifies the Mughal powers. It was built by the famous Mughal
          ruler Shah Jahan in 1648. The foundation stone was laid in the year
          1639, and it took almost nine years to be constructed. Red Fort is
          famous for various reasons, and one among them is its construction. It
          is built using red sandstone and marble and is one of the unique
          features. Red Fort is also famous for its huge enclosing walls. Red
          Fort was previously known as ‘Qila-i-Mubarak’, but it was later known
          as Red Fort due to its construction. It is situated on the Yamuna
          river banks and opposite the famous Chandni Chowk market. Even though
          the Red Fort has seen many years, it still stands young. Like the Taj
          Mahal, it is also known to be one of the wonders of the world. It is
          from the Red Fort that the Prime Minister of India addresses the
          country every year on the 15th of August

          he Hawa Mahal in Jaipur is considered as one of the most iconic
          attractions of the city. The five-storey building looks like a
          honeycomb of a beehive and it is always windy inside, owing to the
          numerous windows and jharokhas. This amazing ventilation that the
          palace enjoys is the reason why it was named as the Hawa Mahal, which
          literally translates into the “Palace of the Winds”. The main purpose
          behind the construction of this palace was to allow the ladies of the
          royal family and the court to observe the busy streets of the Johari
          Bazaar from the many jharokhas of the palace, without being seen
          themselves. The Hawa Mahal is a five-storey building, and it is the
          tallest building in the world that has been built without a
          foundation. It has a curved architecture that leans at an 87 degree
          angle, and a pyramidal shape which has helped it stay erect for
          centuries. The Hawa Mahal is dedicated to Lord Krishna. It is said
          that the shape of the building resembles the crown of Krishna. More
          than a palace, the Hawa Mahal is also a cultural and architectural
          marvel that reflects a truly harmonious amalgamation of the Hindu
          Rajput and Islamic Mughal architectural styles. The Rajput style can
          be seen in the domes canopies and the fluted pillars, while the stone
          inlay filigree work and the arches are perfect depictions of the
          Mughal style of architecture.

          Charminar is a square-shaped structure. It is built with minarets
          which are 56 meters high. It has four minarets. It has a giant-sized
          clock on every side. It also includes a Wazu Khana in the middle where
          people wash their face and hands before going for prayer. It also has
          a fountain at the centre of the Mosque. It is believed that the four
          minarets stand for Islam’s first four Khalifas. The mosque in the
          Charminar is located on the top floor. During the Qutb Shahi period
          the first floor was used as Madarsa. Charminar is very beautiful. The
          structure of it is very huge. From the top of the Charminar, the whole
          city is visible. It feels really amazing to watch the whole view. The
          whole Hyderabad city is built around the great beautiful Charminar.
          Wherever you stand you can see roads are getting out of Charminar into
          the city. There is a huge market which surrounds the Charminar. The
          market is known as Laad Bazaar. It is known for its jewellery,
          especially the beautiful bangles. Also, the Patther Gatti is famous
          for its pearls. Sarojini Naidu has written a poem on it “In The
          Bazaars of Hyderabad”.

          The Golden temple is located in the holy city of the Sikhs, Amritsar.
          The Golden temple is famous for its full golden dome, it is one of the
          most sacred pilgrim spots for Sikhs. The Mandir is built on a 67-ft
          square of marble and is a two storied structure. Maharaja Ranjit Singh
          had the upper half of the building built with approximately 400 kg of
          gold leaf. The Golden Temple is surrounded by a number of other famous
          temples like the Durgiana Temple. The fourth Guru of Sikhs, Guru Ram
          Das, who had initially constructed a pool here, founded Amritsar,
          which houses the Golden Temple or Harmandir Sahib. It is here that
          Sage Valmiki wrote the epic, Ramayana. Rama and Sita are believed to
          have spent their fourteen-year exile in Amritsar, the epicenter of
          Sikhism. To the south of the temple is a garden, and the tower of Baba
          Atal. The Central Sikh Museum is atop the Clock Tower. The ‘Guru Ka
          Langar’ offers free food to around 20,000 people everyday. The number
          shoots up to 100,000 on special occasions. A visitor must cover his /
          her head before entering the temple premises. The Granth Sahib is kept
          in the Temple during the day and is kept in the Akal Takht or Eternal
          Throne in the night. The Akal Takht also houses the ancient weapons
          used by the Sikh warriors. Guru Hargobind established it. The rugged
          old Jubi Tree in the north west corner of the compound is believed to
          possess special powers. It was planted 450 years ago, by the Golden
          Temple’s first high priest, Baba Buddha. Guru-ka-Langar or the
          communal canteen is towards the eastern entrance of the temple
          complex, and it provides free food to all visitors, regardless of
          colour, creed, caste or gender. Visitors to the Golden Temple must
          remove their shoes and cover their heads before entering the temple.
          The temple is less crowded in the early mornings on weekends.
